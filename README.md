# Data_retention_application
Desktop application designed for human resources professionals and designed to store the information of applicants.

Hello there,

I am here with another desktop application I have done in my software internship.
I developed my application using various data storage objects. With the application, personal features are quickly converted into a single sentence and saved in the listbox.

So why was this application developed?

I made observations during my internship. I wanted the improvements I would make to contribute to my company. 
Human resource professionals can receive recorded information with reference to this application quickly.

Thank you for viewing.
See you later!
